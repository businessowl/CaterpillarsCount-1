                    <p>A major goal of the Caterpillars Count! project is to provide a structured way for students and other interested individuals to learn more about the caterpillars and other insects that play a crucial role in our ecosystem.
                    </p>
                    <p>One important avenue for learning is actually <a href='../participate'>participating</a> in Caterpillars Count! surveys. We hope participants gain an appreciation for the wild things that are easily overlooked, and an appreciation for the diversity of life all around us. 
                    </p>
                    <p>We are also very excited to promote additional learning experiences back in the classroom, whether or not you were able to participate in field surveys yourself. We are currently designing educational modules for elementary, middle, and high school classes that explore patterns in the Caterpillars Count! data, test hypotheses, and build on important concepts related to food webs, seasonal phenology, metamorphosis, climate change, and even bird migration.                    </p>
                    <p>Keep an eye on this page where we will post more example modules and learning activities. For now, check out these activities developed by Ryan Garland and Allen Hurlbert:</p>
